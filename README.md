# Mental Health Care Chatbot
  This project is a chatbot implemented using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a neural network architecture. The chatbot is designed to understand user queries and respond appropriately based on predefined intents.

# Features:
Intent Recognition : 
    The chatbot recognizes different intents or categories of user queries.
    
Natural Language Understanding : 
    It understands user messages using NLP techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and bag of words representation.
    
Contextual Responses : 
    The chatbot generates responses based on the predicted intent, providing appropriate and contextual replies to user queries.

# Usage :
Frontend ( After getting inside of my-app directory ) :

    npm start

Backend :

    npm start

Cbot( Flask Server containing the Chatbot ) :

    python app.py

# Tech Stack:
Programming Language : 

   Python, JS

Libraries/Frameworks :

Flask : For building the HTTP server to host the chatbot.

NLTK : For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and lemmatization.

Keras : For building and training neural network models.

Model Deployment : The trained model is hosted using Flask as a RESTful API endpoint.

Version Control : Git and GitHub are used for version control and collaboration.
