# Mental Health Care Chatbot
  This project is a chatbot implemented using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a neural network architecture. The chatbot is designed to understand user queries and respond appropriately based on predefined intents.

# Features:
Intent Recognition : 
    The chatbot recognizes different intents or categories of user queries.
    
Natural Language Understanding : 
    It understands user messages using NLP techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and bag of words representation.
    
Contextual Responses : 
    The chatbot generates responses based on the predicted intent, providing appropriate and contextual replies to user queries.

# Usage :
Frontend:

    npm start

Backend :
